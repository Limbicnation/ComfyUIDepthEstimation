# Dependency Version Fix

## Issue

The original `requirements.txt` file specified outdated versions of key dependencies:
- `Pillow>=9.0.0`
- `numpy>=1.21.2`

These versions caused conflicts with other ComfyUI custom nodes that required:
- `pillow>=9.2.0` (required by colpali-engine)
- `numpy>=1.23.5` (required by scipy)

Additionally, older NumPy versions lacked proper support for `numpy.dtypes`, causing fatal errors.

## Solution

Updated dependency versions in `requirements.txt` to be more compatible with the modern ComfyUI ecosystem:

1. **Pillow**: Updated to `>=9.1.0` (compatible with nodes requiring `>=9.2.0`)
2. **NumPy**: Updated to `>=1.23.0` (resolves issues with `numpy.dtypes`)
3. **Transformers**: Set to `>=4.20.0` (modern but widely compatible)
4. Added explanatory comments to guide future maintenance

## Testing

This fix has been tested to ensure:
- Compatibility with other ComfyUI custom nodes
- Resolution of the NumPy dtypes errors
- Proper functioning of the Depth Estimation node

## Implementation

Applied in the `fix/dependency-versions` branch, addressing just the dependency issues while maintaining all functionality of the original node.

## Future Recommendations

- Consider using more flexible version specifications for dependencies
- Test node installation in a clean ComfyUI environment
- Add integration tests that verify compatibility with other popular nodes
