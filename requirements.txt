# Fix for protobuf errors with transformers
protobuf==3.20.3

# Core dependencies
tokenizers>=0.13.3  # Pre-built version compatible with most platforms
transformers>=4.20.0  # Required for Depth Anything models, but ComfyUI may have a specific version

# Pillow (PIL Fork) - Compatibility with other ComfyUI nodes
Pillow>=9.2.0  # Ensures compatibility with nodes requiring >=9.2.0

# NumPy - Using version that properly supports numpy.dtypes
