# requirements.txt for ComfyUI-DepthEstimation Node

# Transformers library with specific tokenizers version to avoid build issues
tokenizers>=0.13.3,<0.14.0  # Use pre-built version compatible with most platforms
transformers>=4.20.0,<4.37.0 # Required for Depth Anything models

# Pillow (PIL Fork) - Compatibility with other ComfyUI nodes
Pillow>=9.2.0,<10.0.0 # Ensures compatibility with nodes requiring >=9.2.0

# NumPy - Using version that properly supports numpy.dtypes
numpy>=1.23.0,<2.0.0 # Resolves compatibility issues while avoiding NumPy 2.x conflicts

# Additional dependencies specific to depth estimation node
timm>=0.6.12,<0.9.0  # Required for depth estimation models
huggingface-hub>=0.16.0  # For model downloading

# Note: PyTorch dependencies are handled by ComfyUI's core installation
# If you're installing this node directly, ensure torch>=2.0.0 is available
