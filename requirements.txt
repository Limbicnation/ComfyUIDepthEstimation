# requirements.txt for ComfyUI-DepthEstimation Node
# Note: These are minimum requirements. ComfyUI's environment may provide newer versions.

# Core dependencies
tokenizers>=0.13.3  # Pre-built version compatible with most platforms
transformers>=4.20.0  # Required for Depth Anything models, but ComfyUI may have a specific version

# Pillow (PIL Fork) - Compatibility with other ComfyUI nodes
Pillow>=9.2.0  # Ensures compatibility with nodes requiring >=9.2.0

# NumPy - Using version that properly supports numpy.dtypes
numpy>=1.23.0  # Resolves compatibility issues

# Additional dependencies specific to depth estimation node
timm>=0.6.12  # Required for depth estimation models
huggingface-hub>=0.16.0  # For model downloading

# Note: PyTorch dependencies are handled by ComfyUI's core installation
# If you're installing this node directly, ensure torch>=2.0.0 is available
